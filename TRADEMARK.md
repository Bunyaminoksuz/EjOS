"EjOS" and the EjOS logo are used as trademarks and identifiers of the EjOS project
and are claimed by Bünyamin Öksüz ("Owner").
This policy explains how the EjOS trademarks may be used.

## Covered Trademarks
- The name "EjOS"
- The EjOS logo
- Any confusingly similar names, logos, or branding

## What this policy is (and is not)
- This policy governs **trademarks only** (name, logo, and branding).
- The source code is licensed separately under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)** as stated in the LICENSE file.
- Nothing in this policy modifies or limits the rights granted by GPL-3.0 for the source code.

## Permitted use (without permission)
You MAY use the name "EjOS" to refer to the original project in a truthful,
non-misleading, and descriptive manner, including:
- Academic citation or documentation that links to the original repository.
- Bug reports, reviews, comparisons, or compatibility statements.
- Statements such as "based on EjOS" or "forked from EjOS", provided they are
  factual and do not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation.

Additionally:
- Use of the name "EjOS" must not create confusion about the origin of the software.
- Use must not suggest that the Owner endorses or is affiliated with your project.

  service, or product using the name "EjOS" or the EjOS logo.

  similar name (e.g., "EjOS AI", "EjOS OS").
- Use the EjOS logo, or any confusingly similar branding, on modified builds,
  forks, or distributions.
- Use the name or logo in a way that is likely to confuse users into believing
  your project is the official EjOS project.

## Forks and modified versions
- Forks and modified versions must use a **different name and branding**.
- All EjOS logos and branding must be removed from modified versions.
- You must clearly state that your project is an independent fork and is not
  affiliated with or endorsed by the Owner.
